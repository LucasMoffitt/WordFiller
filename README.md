## About WordFiller

WordFiller is an Educational Technology tool for use with an interactive smart board and the Microsoft Kinect. This comprehension tool extracts designated key words from text, to create a challenging comprehension activity for students of all stages and subjects.

Teachers have access to their own library where they can create / edit and share resources.

Students must correctly move each word, or collection of words to where they rightly belong within the text. Students can then examine their accuracy by checking how many words were placed correctly.

This interactive tool scales with the stages and the subjects, as the material that is used is the material YOU present.
